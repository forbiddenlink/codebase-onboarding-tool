================================================================================
TECHNICAL DEBT & IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED
================================================================================

Toast System:
- Currently limited to 4 types - could add more
- No toast queuing system (multiple toasts stack)
- No toast priorities
- Could add progress toasts

Theme System:
- Theme persists in settings API but not localStorage
- Could add more granular theme controls
- Could add custom theme creation
- Animation during theme switch could be smoother

Mobile Responsiveness:
- Tablet view still uses hamburger (could show sidebar)
- Some components not tested on very small screens (<320px)
- Landscape orientation not optimized
- Touch interactions could be enhanced

Breaking Changes:
- Focus areas are hardcoded - need UI to manage them
- Migration guides are placeholders - need real content
- No way to dismiss breaking change alerts
- Could add breaking change severity levels
